"""Remembering an approval that was granted after we stopped waiting.

The sequence this exists for, observed end to end:

  1. the command asks for a key and waits;
  2. nobody taps within the window, so it gives up and says — correctly — that
     the request is still live and to run it again;
  3. the person taps twenty minutes later. The grant is recorded, valid, and
     addressed to a request id nothing remembers;
  4. running the command again creates a NEW request and puts a SECOND prompt
     on their phone, for a question they already answered.

Step 4 is the bug, and it is the kind that makes people stop tapping. The
answer is small: write the request id down, and look for it before asking
again. Then "run it again" does what the message promised.

Kept beside ``known_hosts`` and ``hosts.json`` on the workspace's shared
storage, deliberately: the process that asked is usually gone by the time the
answer arrives — a per-turn agent container, a terminal that was closed — and
the one that picks it up is a different process, often in a different
container. A file in ``/tmp`` would be exactly the wrong place.

It holds an id and a timestamp. Never a value.
