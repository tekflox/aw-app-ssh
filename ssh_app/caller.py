"""Who is asking — the identity a 10min/60min approval is scoped to.

**A copy of aw-app-secrets' ``secrets_app/caller.py``, on purpose.** This
process is in a different container from the app, and it is the only party
that can see its own env and parent shell — the app deriving this on our
behalf would key on the app server's own supervisor, which is identical for
every caller in the workspace. Twenty lines of pure function duplicated across
two repos beats a shared key that silently pools everyone's grants. Keep the
two in step; the shape of the key is the contract.

Approving a secret for ten minutes only means something if "the same caller"
is a thing the system can recognise. It was not: the identity aw-backend
understood was a *command line*, which meant `ssh host` and `rsync host:/x`
in one terminal were two different callers, and an agent — whose container is
rebuilt every turn — was never the same caller twice.

Two identities, in priority order:

* ``session:<uuid>`` — an agent. ``AW_SESSION_ID`` is set in the runner
  container and is stable across turns (verified: it is the same uuid the CLI
  is resumed with, and it survived a context compaction mid-conversation). That
  stability is the whole point — the container dies every turn, the session
  does not, so a window granted on turn one is still valid on turn four.
* ``proc:<host>:<ppid>:<starttime>`` — a terminal. The parent is the shell, and
  its pid is stable for every command typed into it. ``starttime`` is included
  because pids get recycled: without it, a new shell inheriting a dead one's
  pid would inherit its grants too. ``host`` because pid 1234 in the workspace
  container is not pid 1234 in a runner.

If neither can be determined, the answer is **no key**, and no key means no
window — every read asks again. Being unidentified must never mean sharing
whichever window happens to be open.

**What this is not.** Every agent and terminal here runs as the same uid, so a
caller key is an identifier, not a credential: nothing stops a process
claiming another's. It exists to stop *accidental* sharing — one caller
silently spending a window another earned — not to defend against a hostile
one, which would need a different trust boundary altogether. Worth being
explicit about, because a window genuinely does widen exposure: for its
duration, anything in that session reads that secret without a prompt.
